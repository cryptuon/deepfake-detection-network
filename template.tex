\section{Introduction}
In the digital age, the accuracy of digital media has become a key factor in reliable communication. The emergence of deepfake technology, which uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to alter audio and video material, presents an unprecedented challenge to the integrity of information. Deepfakes can undermine public discourse, endanger privacy rights, and disrupt democratic processes by creating convincingly realistic media content.

The rapid development of deepfakes has made the problem worse. As detection methods become more advanced, so do the techniques used to create more complex forgeries, resulting in a competition between forgers and detectors. Traditional centralized methods of content verification are unable to keep up with the vast amount of content and the complexity of these manipulations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a decentralized, scalable, and constantly evolving system that can verify digital media.

This paper presents a new blockchain-based decentralized system that is intended to tackle the issue of deepfake detection. Our system takes advantage of the immutable and transparent features of blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where the authenticity of data can be confirmed without relying on a single centralized entity. Additionally, the system uses smart contracts to motivate the development and implementation of the most advanced deepfake detection algorithms. Our contribution is threefold:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Decentralization} We propose a decentralized architecture that \textit{democratizes the verification process}, allowing multiple stakeholders to participate in maintaining the integrity of digital media.
    \item \textbf{Adaptability} Recognizing the dynamic nature of AI-generated content manipulation, our system is designed to integrate \textit{new detection algorithms} as they emerge. Smart contracts automatically manage the life cycle of these algorithms within the network, ensuring that only the most effective models are utilized.
    \item \textbf{Incentivization} To encourage the continuous improvement of deepfake detection technologies, our system rewards contributors with tokens based on the performance of their algorithms. This not only fosters a competitive environment for innovation, but also ensures that the system remains at the\textit{forefront of detection capability}.
\end{enumerate}

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the existing literature on deepfake detection and its shortcomings. Section 3 outlines the theoretical basis of our proposed system. Section 4 outlines the system architecture, and Section 5 covers the deployment of the algorithms. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work and potential directions for future research.

\section{Related Work}

The digital content verification landscape is constantly changing as artificial intelligence (AI) progresses. To detect deepfakes, a variety of techniques have been used, from traditional digital watermarking to advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms. Research in this area suggests that blockchain's decentralized trust mechanisms and AI's analytical capabilities should be combined for deepfake detection. However, this integration requires new methods of algorithm management and incentive models to ensure a high level of adaptability and responsiveness to the ever-evolving deepfake technology.

\subsection{Deepfake Detection}

The initial strategies for detecting manipulated content were heavily based on manual verification by experts. These techniques often included analysis of visual artifacts or inconsistencies within the content. \citep{9721302} provided comprehensive literature review on deepfake detection summarizing various methodologies, a systematic review covered relevant articles from 2018 to 2020.

With the rise of deepfakes, researchers quickly turned to machine learning for automated detection. \citep{masood2021deepfakes} has detailed analysis of existing tools and ML approaches for deepfake generation and detection, presented in a state-of-the-art review, focusing on both audio and visual deepfakes.

\citep{r√∂ssler2019faceforensics} made significant strides with the introduction of the FaceForensics++ benchmark, which provided a data set to train and evaluate deepfake detection models. This data set became a foundational resource for future research in the field.

\subsection{Blockchain - Trust Mechanism}

In parallel to advances in deepfake detection, blockchain technology has been explored as a means of establishing trust in digital transactions. The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it a powerful tool for verifying the authenticity of digital assets, as discussed by \citep{GUO2022100067} in a survey on blockchain technology and its security, which compared various consensus algorithms and explored blockchain applications.

The fusion of blockchain and AI for content verification is a relatively new area of research. A systematic review of blockchain research done by \citep{doi:10.1080/17517575.2021.1939895} during the period 2016 to 2020 highlighted the technological characteristics and blockchain implementation models, setting the stage for further exploration in the context of deepfake detection.

The use of smart contracts to dynamically manage and incentivize the performance of deepfake detection algorithms is an innovative approach that has not been extensively explored in existing literature. However, the concept of using smart contracts to facilitate decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in other domains has been discussed in \citep{10.1371/journal.pone.0258995} investigating how blockchain-based applications might affect firms' organizations and strategies by 2030.

\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}

Despite these developments, challenges remain, particularly in the scalability and real-time application of detection methods. Current detection algorithms struggle to keep pace with the rapid improvements in deepfake generation, a problem highlighted in a comprehensive study by \citep{wang2023deepfake} from the reliability perspective of deepfake detection.

Furthermore, the ability to detect re-recorded or subtly altered content has been a persistent challenge. The re-recording attack vector is particularly problematic, as it introduces anomalies that automated systems can overlook, as discussed in an analysis of deepfake detection techniques \citep{Nguyen_2022}, which examined the use of sophisticated machine learning algorithms to create falsified media content. Meanwhile, accommodating legitimate alterations to content, such as cropping or resizing, without triggering false detections, is a delicate balance that requires further research.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

This paper examines the theoretical basis of the proposed system, which integrates blockchain technology with AI for deepfake detection. The framework combines elements from computer science, cryptography, and machine learning to create a secure, decentralized solution for verifying digital media. The combination of blockchain and AI, with the help of smart contract technology, offers a promising way to address the difficulties posed by deepfakes. This system seeks to create a decentralized, transparent, and adaptive approach to authenticating digital content by utilizing these technologies.

\paragraph{Blockchain Technology} Blockchain serves as the backbone of the proposed system, providing a decentralized and immutable ledger to record transactions and data. The work of \citep{nakamoto2009bitcoin} on Bitcoin introduced the concept of a decentralized ledger, laying the foundation for subsequent blockchain applications. Recent advances demonstrate the potential for blockchain to ensure data integrity and transparency in various domains, including verification of digital content.

\paragraph{Smart Contracts} Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written in code. They are crucial for automating the management of deepfake detection algorithms within our system. \citep{Wu2022} discussed the evolution of smart contract technology and its increasing role in facilitating complex decentralized applications.

\paragraph{Deep Learning for Deepfake Detection} Deep learning has become a powerful tool for detecting deep-fakes. \citep{passos2023review} provide a comprehensive review of deep learning techniques used in biometric security, including deepfake detection. The adaptability of these models is crucial to keep up with the evolving nature of deep-fake technology.

\paragraph{Integrating AI with Blockchain} The integration of AI and blockchain for content verification is a novel approach that has been gaining traction. A study by \citep{Wang2021TheAO} highlighted the potential of this integration to improve data security and trust in AI applications. They further discuss how blockchain can provide a framework for the reliable deployment of AI models, including those used in deep-fake detection.

\paragraph{Algorithm Management and Dynamic Updating} The dynamic management of algorithms is a critical aspect of the proposed system. The work of \citep{vyas2022} on the use of blockchains to manage AI agents in EHR systems emphasizes the importance of a flexible and adaptable system in response to rapidly evolving AI technologies.
