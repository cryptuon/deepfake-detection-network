Author: [Dipankar Sarkar](https://www.dipankar.name/)

Deepfake technology is a major threat to the integrity of digital media. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for a blockchain-based decentralized system designed to tackle the escalating challenge of digital content integrity. The proposed system integrates advanced deep learning algorithms with the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where authenticity can be verified without relying on a single centralized authority. Furthermore, the system utilizes smart contracts for dynamic algorithm management and token-based incentives further enhances the system's effectiveness and adaptability. The decentralized architecture of the system democratizes the process of verifying digital content and introduces a novel approach to combat deepfakes. The collaborative and adjustable nature of this system sets a new benchmark for digital media integrity, offering a more robust digital media environment.
