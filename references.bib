abstract = {Blockchain is a technology that has desirable features of decentralization, autonomy, integrity, immutability, verification, fault-tolerance, anonymity, auditability, and transparency. In this paper, we first carry out a deeper survey about blockchain technology, especially its history, consensus algorithms' quantitative comparisons, details of cryptography in terms of public key cryptography, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and hash functions used in the blockchain, and the comprehensive list of blockchain applications. Further, the security of blockchain itself is a focus in this paper. In particular, we assess the blockchain security from risk analysis to derive comprehensive blockchain security risk categories, analyze the real attacks and bugs against blockchain, and summarize the recently developed security measures on blockchain. Finally, the challenges and research trends are presented to achieve more scalable and securer blockchain systems for the massive deployments.}

We provide a deep understanding of how the adoption of this technology could lead to changes in Europe over multiple dimensions, ranging from business to culture and society, policy and regulation, economy, and technology. From the projections that reached a significant consensus and were given a high probability of occurrence by the experts, we derive four scenarios built around two main dimensions: the digitization of assets and the change in business models.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

TITLE = {Transfer Learning of a Deep Learning Model for Exploring Tourists’ Urban Image Using Geotagged Photos},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, as computer vision and image processing technologies have rapidly advanced in the artificial intelligence (AI) field, deep learning technologies have been applied in the field of urban and regional study through transfer learning. In the tourism field, studies are emerging to analyze the tourists’ urban image by identifying the visual content of photos. However, previous studies have limitations in properly reflecting unique landscape, cultural characteristics, and traditional elements of the region that are prominent in tourism. With the purpose of going beyond these limitations of previous studies, we crawled 168,216 Flickr photos, created 75 scenes and 13 categories as a tourist’ photo classification by analyzing the characteristics of photos posted by tourists and developed a deep learning model by continuously re-training the Inception-v3 model. The final model shows high accuracy of 85.77% for the Top 1 and 95.69% for the Top 5. The final model was applied to the entire dataset to analyze the regions of attraction and the tourists’ urban image in Seoul. We found that tourists feel attracted to Seoul where the modern features such as skyscrapers and uniquely designed architectures and traditional features such as palaces and cultural elements are mixed together in the city. This work demonstrates a tourist photo classification suitable for local characteristics and the process of re-training a deep learning model to effectively classify a large volume of tourists’ photos.},
